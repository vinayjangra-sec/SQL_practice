# Sales Person

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given three tables containing information about sales representatives, companies, and orders, write a query to find salespeople who have never made sales to a specific company.

**`sales_person` table:**

| Column Name     | Type    |
|-----------------|---------|
| sales_id        | int     |
| name            | varchar |
| salary          | int     |
| commission_rate | int     |
| hire_date       | date    |

The `sales_id` column is the primary key. Each row contains information about a salesperson including their name, salary, commission rate, and when they were hired.

**`company` table:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| com_id      | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| city        | varchar |

The `com_id` column is the primary key. Each row contains the company's ID, name, and the city where it is located.

**`orders` table:**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| order_id    | int  |
| order_date  | date |
| com_id      | int  |
| sales_id    | int  |
| amount      | int  |

The `order_id` column is the primary key. The `com_id` column references the `company` table, and `sales_id` references the `sales_person` table. Each row represents an order with the company, salesperson, date, and amount.

Write a SQL query to find the names of all salespeople who have not made any orders with the company named `"CRIMSON"`.

Return the result in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:**

`sales_person` table:

| sales_id | name  | salary | commission_rate | hire_date  |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 1        | Alice | 95000  | 8               | 2018-03-15 |
| 2        | Bob   | 45000  | 12              | 2019-07-22 |
| 3        | Carol | 72000  | 10              | 2017-11-01 |
| 4        | Dave  | 38000  | 15              | 2020-02-14 |
| 5        | Eve   | 52000  | 6               | 2016-09-30 |

`company` table:

| com_id | name    | city     |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1      | CRIMSON | Seattle  |
| 2      | AZURE   | Portland |
| 3      | GOLDEN  | Denver   |
| 4      | EMERALD | Chicago  |

`orders` table:

| order_id | order_date | com_id | sales_id | amount |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1        | 2021-01-10 | 3      | 4        | 15000  |
| 2        | 2021-02-20 | 4      | 5        | 8000   |
| 3        | 2021-03-05 | 1      | 1        | 62000  |
| 4        | 2021-04-18 | 1      | 4        | 31000  |

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Bob   |
| Carol |
| Eve   |

**Explanation:**

- Alice (`sales_id = 1`) has an order with CRIMSON (order 3), so she is excluded.
- Dave (`sales_id = 4`) has an order with CRIMSON (order 4), so he is excluded.
- Bob, Carol, and Eve have no orders with CRIMSON, so they appear in the result.

## Test Case

**Input:**

`sales_person` table:

| sales_id | name  | salary | commission_rate | hire_date  |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 1        | Alice | 50000  | 10              | 2020-01-01 |
| 2        | Bob   | 50000  | 10              | 2020-01-01 |

`company` table:

| com_id | name    | city     |
|--------|---------|----------|
| 1      | AZURE   | Seattle  |
| 7      | CRIMSON | Portland |

`orders` table:

| order_id | order_date | com_id | sales_id | amount |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1        | 2021-01-01 | 1      | 1        | 1000   |
| 2        | 2021-01-02 | 7      | 2        | 1000   |

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Alice |

**Explanation:**

- Alice's only order is with AZURE, not CRIMSON, so she is included.
- Bob has an order with CRIMSON (`com_id = 7`), so he is excluded.
- CRIMSON's `com_id` is 7 here, not 1, so make sure your query looks up the company by name rather than hardcoding an ID.
