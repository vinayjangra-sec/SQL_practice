# Combine Two Tables

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given two tables, `person` and `address`, write a query that combines information from both.

**`person` table:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| person_id   | int     |
| last_name   | varchar |
| first_name  | varchar |

The `person_id` column is the primary key. This table stores each person's ID along with their first and last name.

**`address` table:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| address_id  | int     |
| person_id   | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |

The `address_id` column is the primary key. Each row links a person (via `person_id`) to their city and state.

Write a SQL query that returns the `first_name`, `last_name`, `city`, and `state` for every person. If a person has no matching address record, return `NULL` for both `city` and `state`.

The result can be returned in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:**

`person` table:

| person_id | last_name | first_name |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1         | Smith     | John       |
| 2         | Johnson   | Emma       |

`address` table:

| address_id | person_id | city        | state      |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1          | 2         | Los Angeles | California |
| 2          | 3         | Chicago     | Illinois   |

**Output:**

| first_name | last_name | city        | state      |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| John       | Smith     | null        | null       |
| Emma       | Johnson   | Los Angeles | California |

**Explanation:**

- John Smith (`person_id = 1`) has no address on file, so `city` and `state` are `NULL`.
- Emma Johnson (`person_id = 2`) lives in Los Angeles, California.
- The address record for `person_id = 3` has no matching person, so it does not appear in the output.
