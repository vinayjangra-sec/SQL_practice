# Top Travellers

**Difficulty:** Easy

Given two tables, `users` and `rides`, write a query to calculate the total distance traveled by each user.

**`users` table:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

The `id` column is the primary key. This table contains user information including their unique ID and name.

**`rides` table:**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| user_id     | int  |
| distance    | int  |

The `id` column is the primary key. Each row represents a trip where `user_id` indicates who took the trip and `distance` is how far they traveled.

Write a SQL query that reports the total distance each user has traveled. Return the results sorted by `travelled_distance` in descending order. If multiple users have the same total distance, sort them by `name` in ascending order.

## Example 1

**Input:**

`users` table:

| id | name   |
|----|--------|
| 1  | Maria  |
| 2  | Carlos |
| 3  | Priya  |
| 4  | James  |

`rides` table:

| id | user_id | distance |
|----|---------|----------|
| 1  | 1       | 150      |
| 2  | 2       | 280      |
| 3  | 3       | 195      |
| 4  | 1       | 130      |
| 5  | 2       | 95       |

**Output:**

| name   | travelled_distance |
|--------|--------------------|
| Carlos | 375                |
| Maria  | 280                |
| Priya  | 195                |
| James  | 0                  |

**Explanation:**

- Carlos has two trips totaling 375 miles (280 + 95).
- Maria has two trips totaling 280 miles (150 + 130).
- Priya has one trip of 195 miles.
- James has no rides recorded, so their traveled distance is 0.

## Test Case

**Input:**

`users` table:

| id | name  |
|----|-------|
| 10 | Ryan  |
| 20 | Chloe |
| 30 | Max   |

`rides` table:

| id | user_id | distance |
|----|---------|----------|
| 1  | 10      | 400      |
| 2  | 20      | 600      |
| 3  | 99      | 1000     |

**Output:**

| name  | travelled_distance |
|-------|--------------------|
| Chloe | 600                |
| Ryan  | 400                |
| Max   | 0                  |

**Explanation:**

- Chloe has one trip of 600.
- Ryan has one trip of 400.
- Max has no rides, so the distance is 0.
- The ride for `user_id = 99` has no matching user, so it does not appear in the output.
