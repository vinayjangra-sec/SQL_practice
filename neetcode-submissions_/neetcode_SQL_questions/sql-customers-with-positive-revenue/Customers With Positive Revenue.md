# Customers With Positive Revenue

You are given a table `customers` which tracks customer revenue across different years.

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| customer_id | int  |
| year        | int  |
| revenue     | int  |

`(customer_id, year)` is the primary key for this table. The revenue can be positive, negative, or zero.

Write a query to find all customers who had positive revenue in the year 2020. Return only the `customer_id` column. The result can be returned in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:** `customers` table:

| customer_id | year | revenue |
|-------------|------|---------|
| 1           | 2019 | 100     |
| 1           | 2020 | 50      |
| 2           | 2020 | -30     |
| 3           | 2019 | 80      |
| 3           | 2020 | 25      |
| 4           | 2020 | 0       |

**Output:**

| customer_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

**Explanation:** Customers 1 and 3 had positive revenue in 2020. Customer 2 had negative revenue, and customer 4 had zero revenue.
