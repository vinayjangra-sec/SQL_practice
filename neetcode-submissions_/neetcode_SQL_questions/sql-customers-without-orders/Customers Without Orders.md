# Customers Without Orders

**Difficulty:** Easy

You are given two tables: `customers` and `orders`.

**`customers` table:**

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

`id` is the primary key for this table. Each row contains the ID and name of a customer.

**`orders` table:**

| Column Name | Type |
|-------------|------|
| id          | int  |
| customer_id | int  |

`id` is the primary key for this table. `customer_id` references the `id` from the `customers` table. Each row contains the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who placed it.

Write a query to find all customers who have never placed an order. Return the customer names. The result can be returned in any order.

## Example 1

**Input:**

`customers` table:

| id | name    |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Alice   |
| 2  | Bob     |
| 3  | Charlie |
| 4  | Diana   |

`orders` table:

| id  | customer_id |
|-----|-------------|
| 101 | 3           |
| 102 | 1           |

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Bob   |
| Diana |

**Explanation:** Bob and Diana have never placed an order. Alice and Charlie have orders in the `orders` table.

## Constraints

- Each customer has a unique ID.
- Each order references a valid customer.
