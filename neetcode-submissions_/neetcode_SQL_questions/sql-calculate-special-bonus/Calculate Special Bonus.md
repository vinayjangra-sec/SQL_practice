# Calculate Special Bonus

**Difficulty:** Easy

You are given an `employees` table containing employee information.

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |

`employee_id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. Each row contains the employee's ID, name, and salary.

Write a query to calculate the bonus for each employee. An employee receives a bonus equal to 100% of their salary if:

- Their `employee_id` is an odd number, **AND**
- Their name does not start with the letter `'M'`

Otherwise, the bonus is 0.

Return the `employee_id` and `bonus` for each employee, ordered by `employee_id`.

## Example 1

**Input:**

`employees` table:

| employee_id | name  | salary |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1           | John  | 5000   |
| 2           | Sarah | 4000   |
| 3           | Mark  | 6000   |
| 4           | Emily | 4500   |
| 5           | David | 5500   |

**Output:**

| employee_id | bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| 1           | 5000  |
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 4           | 0     |
| 5           | 5500  |

**Explanation:**

- Employee 1 (John): ID is odd and name doesn't start with 'M' → bonus = 5000
- Employee 2 (Sarah): ID is even → bonus = 0
- Employee 3 (Mark): ID is odd but name starts with 'M' → bonus = 0
- Employee 4 (Emily): ID is even → bonus = 0
- Employee 5 (David): ID is odd and name doesn't start with 'M' → bonus = 5500

## Constraints

- Each employee has a unique ID.
